# Sequence-Analysis
This repository contains some personal projects about the analysis of sequences which may be useful.
I will upload new ones when they are finished.
Each of the future scripts will have a unique txt file with description.

The Sequence_Analysis script make usage of re and Bio packages.
It analysis the sequence of a local FASTA file, starting from simple statistics such as counting nucleotides and GC content.
Then goes to searching for promoters from a list of pre-defined promoters including TATA box.
At the end it prints also the distances checking if it is physiological.
